        It was a Thursday, but it felt like a Monday to John. And John loved Mondays.
        He thrived at work. He dismissed the old cliché of dreading Monday mornings and
        refused to engage in water-cooler complaints about “the grind” and empty
        conversations that included the familiar parry “How was your weekend?” “Too short!”.
        Yes, John liked his work and was unashamed.

        I should probably get another latte. I’ve just been sitting here with this empty cup.
        But then I’ll start to get jittery. I’ll get a decaf. No, that’s stupid, it feels
        stupid to pay for a decaf. I can’t justify that. John was always impatient on the
        weekends; he missed the formal structure of the business week. When he was younger
        he used to stay late after school on Fridays and come in early on Mondays, a pattern
        his mother referred to with equal parts admiration and disdain as “studying overtime.”
